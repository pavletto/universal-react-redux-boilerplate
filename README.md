# React/Redux universal boilerplate
This repository contains boilerplate for a universal app built from these
amazing open-source technologies:

* React.js for view rendering (universal)
* Redux as a Flux implementation (universal)
* Express for the server-side routing and logic

Universal means that the same code is run both on the server and on the client
(Browser). The language used is EcmaScript 2015 (modern Javascript) with some
future, experimental additions (e.g. decorators) which is transpiled to
deployable JS using Babel. The app can be run using the bundled Docker image,
or deployed to any environment that supports Node.js.

This is the setup that we are transitioning our applications to at the Zetkin
Foundation.
